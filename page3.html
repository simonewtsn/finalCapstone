    <h2>What is a Shipping Container Home?</h>
    <div>
    <h3>   
        A shipping container home is a type of home, usually a small or medium-sized dwelling, 
        that is made out of one or more shipping containers. This type of home has become 
        increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative to traditional construction and 
        due to the availability of inexpensive, used shipping containers.

    Noise: Shipping containers are made of metal, which can create a lot of noise when exposed to wind or rain.<br>
    Insulation: Shipping containers are not insulated, so additional insulation will need to be added.<br>
    Building Regulations: Building regulations may vary from one location to another and shipping container homes may not meet all requirements.<br>
