    <h2>What is an Earthship?</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>
        An Earthship is an off-grid sustainable building made of natural and 
        recycled materials. It is designed to be energy-efficient, self-sustaining, 
        and use renewable resources such as solar, wind and water. Earthships are 
        also designed to be able to withstand extreme weather conditions, such as 
        hurricanes and earthquakes.
