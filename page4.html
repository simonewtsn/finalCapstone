    <h2>What is a Earth Sheltered Home?</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>
    A hobbit home is an earth sheltered home that is designed to 
    blend in with the natural environment. The home is typically 
    made of natural materials such as stone, wood, and earth and 
    is often built into the surrounding landscape.

    Energy efficiency: Earth sheltered homes require less energy to 
    heat and cool than traditional homes, as the soil temperature 
    remains relatively constant and provides insulation.<br>
    Durability: The materials used in earth sheltered homes are usually 
    long-lasting and require little maintenance.<br>
    Aesthetics: Hobbit homes can provide a unique and attractive look to 
    any landscape.<br>
    </td>
    <td>
    Cost: Building an earth sheltered home is usually more expensive than a 
    traditional home, as it requires specialized expertise and materials.<br>
    Moisture: Due to the close proximity of the home to the ground, moisture 
    can become an issue. Proper drainage and ventilation must be taken into 
    account when constructing an earth sheltered home.<br>
